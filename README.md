# Introduction 

This application is submitted as a JHA Coding Challenge. It was written and submitted by Mark Kennedy in February 2023

This single page application (SPA) is written in ASP.NET Core Blazor with C#. It was built with Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 6.

Services are made available to the client GUI by way of dependency injection. All keys and endpoints are local to the server-side and not available on the client.

The Web API utilized by the client is SignalR.

# Getting Started

-	**Installation process**

	The source for this SPA is a public Git repository. So, there is no installation process. In order to develop/modify, users need Visual Studio 2022, VS Code, or proficiency with the DotNet CLI. Developers must also have access to 
	software dependencies and appropriate client keys from the respective API providers.

-	**Software dependencies**

	This SPA uses RestSharp for making HTTP client connections and API calls.
	
	It also uses Telerik grid Controls for Blazor. A trial key will suffice but serves a trial message at runtime.

	This SPA also uses the SyncFusion Spinner control for wait scenarios as data is retrieved. This is using a community license made available for students/learners.

-	**Latest releases**

	This is the latest and final release.

-	**API references**

	APIs utilized are Twitter API.
